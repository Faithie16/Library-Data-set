#### The Image above is the Dashboard I want to create. In few simple steps, I will walk you through how I was able to achieve this.

#### The First step is to perform data cleaning for parts of the data that is not properly arranged. 
#### I selected a few of the columns to capitalize it's texts using the formula =UPPER(Text) as shown in the image below.

#### This is the outcome.

This formula was applied to other cells in the datasheet.

Some dates in a dataset are not properly arranged most times, so the next step is to change the dates to "short date format".
