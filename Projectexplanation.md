#### This project is a Data Management application that helps users organize and prioritize data using Charts, Pivot tables, slicers to create an all in one dashboard in Excel.

#### The Image above is the Dashboard I want to create. In few simple steps, I will walk you through how I was able to achieve this.

#### The First step is to perform data cleaning for parts of the data that is not properly arranged. 
#### I selected a few of the columns to capitalize all texts using the formula =UPPER(Text) while other texts have only the beginning letters capitalized using =PROPER(text).

#### This formula was applied to other cells in the datasheet. 

#### Some dates in a dataset are not properly arranged most times, so the next step is to change the dates to "short date format".

#### The cells are then expanded to look like this.

#### There was still some unwanted date in the birth-date column, I used "Find and Replace" to edit the affected columns.

#### The dataset is then given a much colorful look by highlighting the whole data, click on the insert icon, select table, check all the boxes provided then select your preferred table design, and we're done with the cleanup.
