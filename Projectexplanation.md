# LIBRARY DATA SET

### <u> Data Cleaning <u/>

#### This project is a Data Management application that helps users organize and prioritize data using Charts, Pivot tables, slicers to create an all in one dashboard in Excel.

#### The Image above is the Dashboard I want to create. In few simple steps, I will walk you through how I was able to achieve this.

#### The First step is to perform data cleaning for parts of the data that is not properly arranged. 
#### I selected a few of the columns to capitalize all texts using the formula =UPPER(Text) while other texts have only the beginning letters capitalized using =PROPER(text).

#### This formula was applied to other cells in the datasheet. 

#### Some dates in a dataset are not properly arranged most times, so the next step is to change the dates to "short date format".

#### The cells are then expanded to look like this.

#### There was still some unwanted date in the birth-date column, I used "Find and Replace" to edit the affected columns.

#### The dataset is then given a much colorful look by highlighting the whole data, click on the insert icon, select table, check all the boxes provided then select your preferred table design, and we're done with the cleanup.

## Data Visualization

#### The next step in this project is to visualize the data set provided.
#### Data visualization is the graphical representation of data. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand patterns in data.
#### The data is first analyzed to create a pivot table which contains the particular set of data you want to work with. Then, the chart is created by highlighting the pivot table created.

This step was done for four different data sets. More data sets can be gotten from the original file, it all depends on what you're working on.

### Dashboard Preparation
#### I created another worksheet, highlighted a particular amount of cell and added my preferred color. I highlighted about 4-5 rows in the colored cells and merged them together to insert text on a straight line. Then I created a "Logo" using shapes.
#### The created charts were copied one after another and pasted on the new dashboard worksheet and carefully arranged in order.
#### I proceeded to create slicers for the four datasets / charts created on the dashboard sheet.

I checked only the boxes that corresponds with the data which I pulled out from the original dataset. 

This is what a slicer looks like.

#### The four slicers created a then connected together by selecting all pivot table created for each slicers. Once the slicers are connected, they all function together.

#### This is what the outcome of our project looks like now.

This is a summary on how to Visualize data on Excel dashboard
